# SO-experiment

This is the repo for an experiment on attaching tags to StackOverflow questions. I am including the `requirements.txt` file, with the needed dependencies.

In order to run the notebook, just create a new virtual environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Python version 3.10 was used.
